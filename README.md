My name is Santiago Montiel Mar√≠n, currently studying the fourth and last year of a BSc degree in Electronics and Industrial Automation Engineering at University of Alcal√°. As a research staff member of RobeSafe Research Group (Electronics Department, University of Alcal√°), I am developing my Final's Degree Project "Multi Object-Tracking system based on LiDAR and RADAR for Intelligent Vehicles applications" under the supervision of Prof. Luis Miguel Bergasa and PhD student Carlos G√≥mez Hu√©lamo. I would like this project to become the starting point of my research career. Main areas of interest consist of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Robotics, Embedded Systems, Perception in Intelligent Vehicles and any field related to these.
